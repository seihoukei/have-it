# Just have it

A small incremental game, spawned out of discussion whether incremental games 
without numbers going big is possible. This little game can only have up to 1 of each resource,
so you need to just have it to be able to pay a cost with it.

It's not a full-fledged game, just a proof of concept, and while flow of upgrades 
is fully generated, game is not endless, but gets very repetitive long before 
the last resource.
